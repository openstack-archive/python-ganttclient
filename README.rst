Python bindings to Gantt API
=====================

This is a client library for Gantt built on the Gantt API. It provides 
a Python API (the ``ganttclient`` module) and a command-line tool
(``gantt``).

Development takes place via the usual OpenStack processes as outlined in the
`OpenStack wiki <http://wiki.openstack.org/HowToContribute>`_.  The master
repository is on `GitHub <http://github.com/openstack/python-ganttclient>`_.
